## Voice Categories

| Category | Voices | Description |

| Chirp 3: HD | 30 | Latest generation — the most natural-sounding voices |
| Chirp HD | 3 | High-definition neural voices |
| Studio | 2 | Studio-quality narration (5x character cost) |

| WaveNet | 10 | DeepMind WaveNet synthesis |
| Standard | 10 | Basic synthesis — fast and reliable |
| Specialty | 5 | Purpose-built voices (casual, news, polyglot) |

Higher tiers unlock more categories. Free starts with Standard, and each tier adds new voice types up through Studio at The Archmage level.
